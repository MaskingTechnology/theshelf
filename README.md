# The Shelf

Configurable TypeScript packages for common concerns that can be used "off the shelf".

All packages provide a generic interface that supports multiple implementations.
Implementations are configured via environment variables.

**NOTE**: This project is derived from an internal project and is still in a very early stage.

## Packages

There are packages for the following concerns:

* [**Authentication**](./packages/authentication/README.md) - access and identity management.
* [**Database**](./packages/database/README.md) - storing and retrieving data.
* [**Event broker**](./packages/eventbroker/README.md) - event management.
* [**File store**](./packages/filestore/README.md) - storing and retrieving files.
* [**HTTP**](./packages/http/README.md) - outgoing HTTP requests.
* [**Logging**](./packages/logging/README.md) - application logging.
* [**Notification**](./packages/notification/README.md) - push notifications.
* [**Validation**](./packages/validation/README.md) - data validation.
